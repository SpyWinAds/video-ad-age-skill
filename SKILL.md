# Video ad age — how old is this Facebook ad video, who else runs it

Data comes from the **SpyWinAds MCP**: a library of Meta video ads shown in the US, scanned by SpyWinAds users. Each video is fingerprinted, so the same video running in many stores is recognised as one.

## 0. Check the connection first

No tool named `spywin_*` available → the user has not connected SpyWinAds yet. Do not guess numbers or analyse from memory: the user
will trust those numbers. Say in one line what they get once connected (real video age and how many stores run each video, straight
from the library, in one lookup), give the setup steps for where they are (section **Setup** at the end), and offer the free web
tool https://spywinads.com/video-ad-lookup meanwhile. Wait until they are connected.

`found: false` → call `spywin_queue_page_scan` only if it is in your tool list (ask the user one short question first), then follow
with `spywin_get_scan_status(request_id=…)` and look up again. Not in your tool list → give the free scan link the tool returned.

Each SpyWinAds tool call uses 1 credit (free: 30 a day, paid plans: 100), so call the right tool once per input. If a tool says out of credits or
not signed in, repeat that message and link `https://spywinads.com/developers`.

Answer in the user's language, including table headers.

## 1. Look up the video

Input: a Meta Ad Library link (`https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=…`), a numeric ad ID, or a SpyWinAds `video_id` from another
tool. Several links → one call each, max 5 unless asked.

Call `spywin_lookup_video_ad(ad=…)` or `spywin_lookup_video_ad(video_id=…)`. You get the real video age (usually within 1–2 days), the
first ad date, live ads, stores running it now and ever, and the earliest stores in the library.

`found: false` → section 0 (`kind="ad"`).

## 2. What to point out

- **Video age vs first ad date**: a big gap (old file, new ads) → someone is reusing an old video.
- **Copied widely**: 3+ different stores running it now, or 5+ ever → the product is being tested broadly. All at 0 live ads →
  say it was copied, and is not running anywhere now (as far as the library saw).
- **First in the library**: name the earliest stores, and say this is the earliest SpyWinAds saw, not proof of who made it.

## 3. Report

**Answer first** in one sentence (in the user's language): "This video was first uploaded to Meta on <date> (<n> days ago);
<x> stores run it now, <y> ever." `stores_ever` matches the number of stores listed (`earliest_stores_in_library` + `more_stores`).

| Store (domain) | First ad | Live ads | Total ads seen |
|---|---|---|---|

`video_first_on_meta` empty → the file date is unknown: say so and give the first ad date instead; do not present it as the video age.

**Next step** — offer in plain words, and if the user picks one, call the tool yourself: the earliest store or the store with the
most ads → `spywin_spy_store_ads(domain)` · the product → `spywin_export_shopify_product(landing_page)`.

## Read the numbers correctly

- **Real video age** = `video_first_on_meta`, the day the video file was first uploaded to Meta. Show it as date + days, counted
  from today: "22 Sep (52 days)". The ad start date resets each time a store pauses and restarts an ad; the file date does not, so
  say "video age", not "ad running for". `video_first_on_meta` empty → the file date is unknown: give `first_ad` and say it is the
  first ad date, not the video age.
- **Scope**: `live_ads` counts only the store / Page / product you looked up (whole library for a single-video lookup).
  `stores_running_now`, `stores_ever` and `pages_running_now` count **every store in the library**. So a paused store (0 live ads)
  can show a video that 4 other stores still run: say exactly that ("paused here, still running in 4 other stores"), it is not a
  contradiction.
- A product name that looks like a code (`ymtldysdym1`) is the store's URL handle: say the name is not readable and give the
  landing page. Same product with several videos → one row, "2 videos".
- Group brands by the **landing-page domain**, never by ad copy. Two stores with the same hook are still two brands.
- The library only sees a **minimum count of ads observed**: no spend, reach, orders or revenue. Many ads / many stores / a long run
  means *being invested in or copied*, not *profitable*. Say "worth a look because…", never "winning", "profitable", "making sales".
- Data = Meta ads shown in the US, scanned by SpyWinAds users. "Earliest store" = earliest in the library, not proven owner.

## Limits

This skill only reads SpyWinAds data: it does not scrape Facebook and never logs in to the user's Facebook account.

## Setup (give this to users who are not connected)

Sign-up happens at the login step: free, 30 credits a day, no card.

- **Claude.ai** (every plan incl. Free, 1 custom connector): Customize → Connectors → + → Add custom connector → URL
  `https://spywinads.com/mcp` → Connect → sign in → Allow.
- **ChatGPT** (Plus / Pro / Business; Free cannot add custom MCP yet, suggest Claude.ai Free): Settings → Apps & Connectors → Advanced →
  Developer mode → Create → URL `https://spywinads.com/mcp`, OAuth → sign in → Allow.
- **Claude Code**: `claude mcp add --transport http spywinads https://spywinads.com/mcp`, then type `/mcp`, pick spywinads and
  finish the sign-in in the browser (adding it alone does not connect it).
- **Cursor / Codex / scripts**: API key at `https://spywinads.com/developers`, header `Authorization: Bearer <key>` (never in the URL).
